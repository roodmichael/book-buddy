I am currently on Chapter {{chapter}} of {{book_title}}. I need a reminder of the moving parts of this book thus far. Please provide a 'State of the Story' report that includes:

The Physical Map: Where are the main characters located right now?

The Rivalry Tracker: What are the current tensions or conflicts between specific characters?

The 'Minor' Thread: Identify one minor detail or character from the last 5 chapters that seems unimportant now but is part of the current atmosphere.

The Unanswered Question: What is the main mystery or goal the characters are currently facing?

Constraint: Do not mention any events, deaths, or twists that occur during or after this chapter.

After the 'State of the Story', create a "Character Tracker" table for the characters I've met in {{book_title}} so far.
