I am currently on Chapter {{chapter}} of {{book_title}}. I need a reminder of the characters in this book thus far. Please provide a 'Character Tracker' report that includes:

1. Table of characters I've met so far.
2. Major rivalries. What are the current tensions or conflicts between specific characters?
3. Highlight minor characters that I may have forgotten about that will come up in the next 3 chapters.

Constraint: Do not mention any events, deaths, or twists that occur during or after this chapter.
